# project

Suggestions for what to do welcome.

What langauges do you code in?  I've been slowly teaching myself Python and wanted to try and develop a webscraper, or something similar to grab the updated delivery time on my woolies online orders.  Do you use woolies?  Unlike ocado in the UK, they give you a window that updates, but you have to click on a link to get the updates, i wanted my google calendar to get the updated time or maybe even send myself and email or text if the time updates.  

Interested?
